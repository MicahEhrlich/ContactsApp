# ContactsApp
A basic Web Application for adding/updating/deleting contacts stored in a database.

Once you clone this repository you need to perform these steps to run the app:

1. Run the following scripts in the server folder to create the database: 
        create_db.sql	
        create_table.sql
    This requires SQL Server to be installed and running on your machine
2. Open the .Net project inside the server folder and run it, it should be running at 'https://localhost:44339/'
3. Inside the client folder, open contacts-app folder and from there run the following command:
        npm start
   It should open in the browser at 'localhost:3000'
   
   Now you should be able to have app running.
